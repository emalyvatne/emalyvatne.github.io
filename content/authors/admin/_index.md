Hi!! My name is Emaly Vatne and I am a second-year PhD student in kinesiology and statistical data analysis at Ohio State. I also work for the Ohio State Department of Athletics and Human Performance Collaborative in sport and performance science. Before all of this, I played 5 seasons on the Ohio State varsity women's soccer team. I started this site to track my progress and projects over the next few years and to share what I learn along the way. Go bucks!!!
