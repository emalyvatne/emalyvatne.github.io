abstract: 'Background: This study’s purpose was to evaluate the relationship between dance training volume, body composition, and habitual diet in female collegiate dancers. Methods: Thirty-three female collegiate dancers from three dance programs (20.4 ± 1.05 yrs.; 165.4 ± 11.3 cm, BMI 21.3 ± 3.4 kg/m2) participated in “The Intercollegiate Artistic Athlete Research Assessment (TIAARA)” study. We assessed dance training volume, body composition, and habitual diet. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (means ± SD). Two-sample t-tests were conducted to compare reported intake values versus sports nutrition recommendations. Two-tailed Pearson correlations (r) were computed for body composition and dietary intake (p < 0.05). Results: Collegiate dancers were enrolled in 16 ± 2.09 semester credits, with 7.7 ± 3.8 credits as dance movement courses and an additional 3.0 ± 1.5 h/week of rehearsal time. Body composition assessments included fat mass (24.4 ± 6.8%), lean mass (LM) (42.4 ± 10.1 kg), and total body water (32.6 ± 4.6 L). Habitual diets reflected a low-calorie diet (1399 ± 648 kcal/d), with ~20% of dancers consuming a very low-calorie diet (≤1000 kcal/d). Dancers reported under-consuming dietary protein (54.3 ± 26.2 g) and carbohydrate (171.8 ± 77.8 g). LM was positively correlated with daily total energy (r = 0.333), fat (r = 0.37), protein (r = 0.349), and leucine intake (r = 0.352). Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the positive effect of adequate nutritional quantity and quality on body composition in female collegiate dancers.'
