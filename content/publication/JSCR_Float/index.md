abstract: 'The primary aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between floatation-restricted environmental stimulation therapy (floatation-REST) and nocturnal cardiovascular physiology and sleep in collegiate athletes. The secondary aim was to describe the perceived changes in soreness, mood, fatigue, and energy level after floatation-REST and the overall floatation-REST experience in collegiate athletes. Data included 183 records of nocturnal cardiovascular physiology and sleep collected using a wearable device from 89 athletes (49.43% women) on 12 different varsity sports, and 2319 survey responses collected immediately after the floatation-REST session from 907 athletes (49.17% women) across 24 varsity sports. Resting heart rate (RHR) (p < 0.001, effect size (ES) = -0.367) but not heart rate variability (HRV) or sleep metrics were significantly different in female athletes and both RHR (p = 0.017, ES = -0.227)  and HRV (p = 0.032, ES = 0.189) but not sleep metrics were significantly different in male athletes after the floatation-REST session compared to the seven-day rolling average before the session. 98.6% of the survey responses reported an overall good floatation-REST experience and 85.3% reported feeling better after the session. Athletes also reported reduced soreness, stress, fatigue, and improved energy level. These findings demonstrate the relationship between floatation-REST and nocturnal cardiovascular physiology and subjective recovery in collegiate athletes. Periods of autonomic imbalance and fatigue may be an ideal time for practitioners to recommend floatation-REST to athletes and strategic designs of athlete monitoring paradigms may allow for insights into the effects of recovery modalities on athletes in applied settings.'
