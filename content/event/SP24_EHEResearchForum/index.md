summary: "A poster presentation comparing the psychological effects of wet versus dry floatation-restricted environmental stimulation therapy session among college students."

abstract: 'Context: Floatation-restricted environmental stimulation therapy (floatation-REST) is a recovery modality that has been shown to reduce anxiety, fatigue, and soreness while improving mood and energy levels. Traditional wet floatation-REST includes lying supine in skin-temperature, concentrated Epsom salt water in a warm, dark, and quiet setting. Dry floatation-REST is a novel alternative to wet floatation-REST that also involves lying supine in a warm, dark, and quiet environment, but a thin layer of plastic separates the participant and the water. Thus, dry floatation-REST eliminates the need for immersion in salt water. Since dry floatation-REST could be a less time-demanding and more comfortable alternative to wet floatation-REST, scientific investigations into its efficacy and comparisons to wet floatation-REST are warranted. Purpose: Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to compare the subjective, psychological effects of wet versus dry floatation-REST. Methods: In this within-subjects, crossover design, 16 college students were randomly assigned to the wet or dry floatation-REST first. They completed a four-week block with two sessions per week of the assigned type of floatation-REST, a two-week washout period, and then crossed over to complete a four-week block of the other type of floatation-REST. Participants completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before and after every floatation-REST session. The pre- and post-session scores for each type of floatation-REST were averaged for the positive and negative STAI questions. A 2 (time: Pre vs. Post) X 2 (floatation-REST type: Wet vs. Dry) Repeated Measures ANOVA was used to analyze mean differences for the average responses of the positive and negative STAI questions. Statistical significance was set a priori at p â‰¤ 0.05. Results: The twoway ANOVAs reveled in no significant interaction between time and floatation-REST type for positive or negative average responses (p = 0.779, p = 0.717). However, there was a main effect of time for both the positive and negative average responses (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). There was no main effect of type of floatation-REST for positive or negative average responses (p = 0.524, p = 0.137). Implications: Wet and dry floatation-REST both significantly improved positive feelings
and reduced negative feelings according to the STAI responses before and after the floatationREST session. However, there was not a significant difference in the amount of change pre- vs. post-session between wet and dry floatation-REST. The results demonstrate that floatation-REST comparably improve subjective mood, reduce anxiety, and enhance emotional wellbeing.'
